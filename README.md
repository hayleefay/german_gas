This is the code for the thesis for my master's degree in computational social science

## TODO

### Exploratory
- [ ] Create maps
- [ ] Find examples
- [ ] Try basic regression
- [ ] Look at price variation among regions/etc.

### Neural Net
- [ ] Add non-numeric predictors to neural network
- [ ] Try test cases of predictions
- [ ] Check interpretation
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Run on Google Cloud
- [ ] Try without various predictors and see how successful for how many days
- [ ] Try mean absolute error
- [ ] Normalize data
- [ ] Create my own training/validation sets so that it is predicting future rather than intermediate days
- [ ] Measure diminishing accuracy and plot
